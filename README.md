Make from chisel-template
=======================

### Dependencies

#### JDK 11 or newer

We recommend using Java 11 or later LTS releases. While Chisel itself works with Java 8, our preferred build tool Mill requires Java 11. You can install the JDK as your operating system recommends, or use the prebuilt binaries from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) (formerly AdoptOpenJDK).

#### SBT or mill

SBT is the most common build tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
Mill is another Scala/Java build tool preferred by Chisel's developers.
This repository includes a bootstrap script `./mill` so that no installation is necessary.
You can read more about Mill on its website: https://mill-build.org.

#### Verilator

The test with `svsim` needs Verilator installed.
See Verilator installation instructions [here](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html).

#### Commit your changes
```sh
git commit -m 'Starting rv32'
git push origin main
```

### Did it work?

You should now have a working Chisel3 project.

You can run the included test with:
```sh
sbt test
```

Alternatively, if you use Mill:
```sh
./mill rv32.compile
./mill rv32.test
```

You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines
```
[info] Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
```
For single module test 
```sh
./mill rv32.test.testOnly rv32.XXXSpec
```
